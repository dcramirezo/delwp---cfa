During this time we get immersed in the department in order to identify different issues around their services and processes. Once we defined some problems, we will work using agile principles by regularly moving through sprints consisting on research, prototyping, and user testing as we go.\r\n\r\n### Our projects\r\n\r\n#### Wildlife incidents, emergencies, land issues & illegal actions\r\nThis project is designed to assist Victoria's volunteer wildlife rehabilitators and institutes, DELWP regional staff and general users. We are doing this by building a responsive website to educate on local wildlife and to inform the community on emergency contacts and procedures when dealing with wildlife.\r\n\r\nThis allows users to interact via their mobile and also reduces strain on local wildlife centers by reducing calls to incorrect sources through education.\r\n\r\n#### Planned Burns Map\r\nThis project is to build a first stage planned burns map with user-centered design that will eventually link to the Fire Management site. The current Planned Burns maps are spread over 3 different maps: current burns, planned burns and past burns, as well as, create a link to their current a [Planned Burns Notification System](https://www.pbns.vic.gov.au/notifications/). \r\n\r\nOur design will incorporate all these maps in a more user-friendly design, as well as, to provide the community with a more accessible way to recognize current burns in their area and the reason behind these.\r\n\r\n",
