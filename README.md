## Our Fellowship
Our fellowship program consists in researching user needs, meeting with stakeholders, proposing solutions, and collaborating with the government to build technology using an iterative approach, centered around the needs of users over a 1-year period. During this time we get immersed in the department in order to identify different issues around their services and processes. Once we defined some problems, we will work using agile principles by regularly moving through sprints consisting on research, prototyping, and user testing as we go.

### Our projects

#### Wildlife incidents, emergencies, land issues & illegal actions
This project is designed to assist Victoria's volunteer wildlife rehabilitators and institutes, DELWP regional staff and general users. We are doing this by building a responsive website to educate on local wildlife and to inform the community on emergency contacts and procedures when dealing with wildlife.

This allows users to interact via their mobile and also reduces strain on local wildlife centers by reducing calls to incorrect sources through education.

#### Planned Burns Map
This project is to build a first stage planned burns map with user-centered design that will eventually link to the Fire Management site. The current Planned Burns maps are spread over 3 different maps: current burns, planned burns and past burns, as well as, create a link to their current a [Planned Burns Notification System](https://www.pbns.vic.gov.au/notifications/). 

Our design will incorporate all these maps in a more user-friendly design, as well as, to provide the community with a more accessible way to recognize current burns in their area and the reason behind these.
