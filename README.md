# Welcome to our space!
This is all about the projects we're working on in partnership with the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning in Victoria, during our fellowship Code for Australia.

## Our Fellowship
Our fellowship program consists in researching user needs, meeting with stakeholders, proposing solutions, and collaborating with the government to build technology using an iterative approach, centered around the needs of users over a 1-year period. 

During this time we get immersed in the department in order to identify different issues around their services and processes. Once we defined some problems, we will work using agile principles by regularly moving through sprints consisting on research, prototyping, and user testing as we go.

At the moment, we are working in 2 different projects:

#### Wildlife incidents, emergencies, land issues & illegal actions
This project is designed to educate on local wildlife and to inform the community on emergency contacts and procedures when dealing with wildlife, reducing calls to incorrect sources through education.

#### Planned Burns Map
This project is design to incorporate different stages of Planned Burns with information on past, current and future burns in a more user-friendly and accessible mapping tool, in order to provide the community a better experience when identifying current burns aroudn their locations, as well as, an interactive and educational overview of the reasons behind these burns.
